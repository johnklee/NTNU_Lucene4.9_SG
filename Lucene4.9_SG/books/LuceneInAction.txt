When Lucene first appeared, this superfast search engine was nothing short of amazing. Today, Lucene still delivers. Its high-performance, easy-to-use API, features like numeric fields, payloads, near-real-time search, and huge increases in indexing and searching speed make it the leading search tool. From manning production.
